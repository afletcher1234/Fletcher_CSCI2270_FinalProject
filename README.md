# Fletcher_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This project is designed to calculate effective routes between a fixed starting point and Regent drive during specific times of day. The user can choose certain landarks which must be included or excluded from the path calculations and take into account factors such as toll roads, speed limits and road type. Landmarks and features will be stored in a linked list or bst and can be modified by the user. The graph will be able to be traversed using a breadth-first algorithm or a depth-first search algorithm.
